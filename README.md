# Supervised Machine Learning Challenge

## Background
Lending services companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market.

Using this data I create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, I compare the Logistic Regression model and RandomForest Classifier.

## Data
The data is located in the Resources Folder:

lending_data.csv

Data imported using Pandas

## Predict Model Performance
A prediction was made as to which model, Logistic Regression or RandomForest Classifier, would perform better. Prediction was written in designated Jupyter Notebook cells with justification.

## Fit a Logistic Regression model and RandomForest Classifier model
Created a Logistic Regression model, fitted to the data, and printed the model's score. Did the same for a RandomForest Classifier. Results and thoughts on which model performed better and how it compared to my prediction were again written in the Jupyter Notebook.
